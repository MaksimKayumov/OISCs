# What is an OISC?
One Instruction Set Computer(OISC) is an RISC(Reduced Set Computer) - Computer with small number of instructions.
# List of my OISCs
In all of my OISCs variables starts at zero
* Addjump ```a;b;``` - add 1 to variable ```a``` and goto 1-indexed command ```b```. It was inprised by FlipJump.
* Smaller ```a;b;``` - add variable ```a``` and integer ```b```(can be negative to substract from ```a```) and if result was 0 goto to the start of program.
## OISCs that have their own Github page:
* [SetGoto](https://github.com/MaksimKayumov/SeGo)
